## Quick update.
Apologies for not being very active on here recently - I've just got a new job and the training is very intense, so I haven't had time to spend on this recently. When my training finishes, I will have a lot more time free to spend on this widget!


## About this widget
This is an updated version of the "plasma-applet-weather-widget" by Kotelnik, but using the Met.No API instead of the Yr.No API which is no longer operational.

## Installation Instructions, and Documentation

I am just a hobbyist / enthusiastic amateur - I'm sure a professional Javascript / QML programmer will be horrified with my code! So bug reports, suggestions, code polishes and bugfixes are welcome - as are translations (as Google Translate may not have been entirely accurate)!
